# ATOMIC Clustering
A python baesed interpretable clustering method based on the topology of a dataset, using novelty search with local competition. This method is outlined in the GEECO 24 poster entitled ATOMIC: an Interpretable Clustering Method Based on Data Topology. 

The evolutionary portion of algorithm is implemented using the DEAP library which can be found at https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/about.html and in “DEAP: Evolutionary Algorithms Made Easy”
